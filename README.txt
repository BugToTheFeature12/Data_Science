In pandas, I have small issues with the two dataset formatting and joining.
Also because of time shortage, I made the two ID column date to sting formatting in Excel.

The only thing I made is delete [' ', ':', and '-'] from the date and reduce the date to only digits.

So the bike_rent_v2_dataset_join.ipynb will only work if you correct this before the csv read.

I got issues with the comma and dot as the decimal number separator. So i also replace it in excel.
The PowerBI will only work if you get the correct decimal format [0,1 or 0.1].
